# Sayeed.Generic.OnionArchitecture

Welcome to Sayeed.Generic.OnionArchitecture, a versatile class library that implements the Onion Architecture pattern and provides generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your ASP.NET Core Web APIs and other applications.

## What is Onion Architecture?

Onion Architecture is a software architectural pattern that aims to create a clear separation of concerns in an application. The architecture is built around the core concept of placing the most important business logic and entities at the center (the core), while surrounding it with layers that decrease in importance. These layers include the Domain/Business Layer, Data Access Layer, and Presentation/Controller Layer.

## Key Features

- **Generic Data Layer**: The data layer in this library is designed to be generic, allowing you to easily perform CRUD operations on different types of entities without writing repetitive code.

- **Business Layer**: The business layer encapsulates your core application logic and ensures that the data layer operations are done according to your business rules and validations.

- **Controller Layer**: The controller layer handles the presentation and user interface, interacting with the Web API or other application endpoints.

- **Easy Integration**: By inheriting the provided onion layers, you can quickly integrate the generic CRUD operations into your application without having to write the same boilerplate code repeatedly.
